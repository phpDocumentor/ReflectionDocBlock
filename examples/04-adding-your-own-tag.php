/**
 * An example of a custom tag called `my-tag` with an optional description.
 *
 * A Custom Tag is a class that can consist of two parts:
 *
 * 1. a method `create` that is a static factory for this class.
 * 2. methods and properties that have this object act as an immutable Value Object representing a Tag instance.
 *
 * The static factory `create` is used to convert a tag line (without the tag name) into an instance of the
 * same tag object with the right constructor parameters set. This method has a dynamic list of parameters so that you
 * can inject various dependencies, see the method's DocBlock for more information.
 *
 * An object of this class, and its methods and properties, represent a single instance of that tag in your
 * documentation in the form of a Value Object whose properties should not be changed after instantiation (it should be
 * immutable).
 *
 * > Important: Tag classes that act as Factories using the `create` method should implement the TagFactory interface.
